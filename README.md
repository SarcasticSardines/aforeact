# Peer Review:
+ By: Caleb Sylvia
+ Review: Site looks really good and well put together. Responsiveness is great and lays out well to make the user experience enjoyable. Couple issues, the mad libs I was not able to populate into the text box and it was a little unclear as to how I should be entering it in. I thought the white box was the button and the text was not there or something so maybe add something to indicate that the result will be there. The second one is that the font size on desktop is a bit small and hard to reach especially with the numbers. The number 5 looks like a S when it is that small so maybe make them a bit more proportional to the text box size but other than that the rest of the site looks great. Good job!
